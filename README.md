The project is in a very early state, you're very likely to experience bugs.
I'm using it as my daily driver, but you should expect a very bare bone
experience if you're considering doing the same.

## Trivia

The name snailctl is inspired by [Leucochloridium], a parasite that lives
inside a snail and is able to control its host. In the long term, `snaild` is
the process that interfaces with the snails brain and `snailctl` is the utility
to control the snail through `snaild`.

The logo has been created by Baudon in 1879.
