**Disclaimer:** The project is in a very early state, you're very likely to
experience bugs. I'm using it as my daily driver, but you should expect a very
bare bone experience if you're considering doing the same.

Parasitic network manager. snail is trying to fill the gap of a metasploit-like
network manager. Its core feature is a scripting engine that can be used to
match known networks and also interact with captive portals if one is
discovered. Have a look at the [scripts/](scripts/) folder for examples. The
basic idea is that you're trying to get connectivity, but you don't really care
where it's actually coming from. Please remain seated and keep your arms and
legs inside the firewall at all times.

## Installation

If possible, use the [snail-git] package for archlinux. For a manual setup on a
debian based system, install the dependency libraries `libseccomp-dev`,
`libdbus-1-dev` and `libzmq3-dev`.

[snail-git]: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/snail-git/

Next, build the binary:
```
cargo build --release
```

And install it:
```
install -Dm755 target/release/snail{d,ctl} /usr/bin
install -Dm644 scripts/* -t /usr/lib/snaild/scripts

install -d /etc/snail/scripts
install -Dm644 contrib/snail.conf -t /etc/snail
install -Dm644 contrib/snail@.service -t /usr/lib/systemd/system
install -Dm644 contrib/snail-tmpfiles.conf /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/snail.conf

systemd-tmpfiles --create
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now snail@wlp3s0
```

You can monitor your network status with snailctl. Make sure your user is in
the correct group which is specified in /etc/snail/snail.conf.
```
snailctl status
```

## snailctl decap

The captive portal engine should run automatically as part of snaild, but it's
also possible to invoke it manually.

To execute the engine in verbose mode, run:
```
snailctl decap -v
```

Some portals also hijack the android captive portal probe, in that case you can
bypass the captive portal test and execute the scripts directly by running:
```
snailctl decap -vf
```

If you are developing a new script, you can provide the path to that script
using:
```
snailctl decap -v ~/scripts/foo.lua
```

By default, custom scripts are loaded from `/etc/snail/scripts/*.lua`, but you
can also add additional folders to `/etc/snail/snail.conf`:
```
[scripts.paths."/home/user/snail/scripts"]
[scripts.paths."/opt/snail/scripts"]
```

To ensure your script is properly being picked up, run snailctl without any
arguments:
```
snailctl
```

If you wrote a new script for a captive portal, please submit a pull request.

## snaild dns

snaild contains a dns server that listens for dns queries on localhost and
forwards them to a dns-over-https recursor. You can also configure your own
zones that get forwarded to a different dns recursor, or hardcode static dns
records.

```toml
[dns]
bind = "127.0.0.1:53"

# cloudflare
servers = ["1.1.1.1",
           "1.0.0.1",
           "2606:4700:4700::1111",
           "2606:4700:4700::1001"]
port = 443
sni = "cloudflare-dns.com"

[dns.records]
"foo.example.com" = ["192.0.2.10", "2001:DB8::10"]
"bar.example.com" = ["192.0.2.20", "2001:DB8::20"]

[dns.zones]
"example.com" = ["192.0.2.2", "2001:DB8::2"]
"corp.example.com" = ["192.0.2.3", "2001:DB8::3"]
```

## Trivia

The name snailctl is inspired by [Leucochloridium], a parasite that lives
inside a snail and is able to control its host. In the long term, `snaild` is
the process that interfaces with the snails brain and `snailctl` is the utility
to control the snail through `snaild`.

The logo has been created by Baudon in 1879.
